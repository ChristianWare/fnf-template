          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to Nier Transportation&#39;s Accessibility Policy. We are
            committed to making our website accessible to all individuals,
            including those with disabilities. This policy outlines our efforts
            to ensure that our website is accessible and usable to the widest
            possible audience.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>2. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</h2>
          <p>
            We strive to comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
            (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA, a globally recognized standard for web
            accessibility. Our efforts include:
            <br />
            <br />
            - Providing alternative text descriptions for non-text content, such
            as images and multimedia.
            <br />
            <br />- Ensuring that our website is navigable using keyboard-only
            or screen-reader technology.
            <br />
            <br />- Using adaptable and responsive design principles to
            accommodate various devices and screen sizes.
            <br />
            <br />- Offering clear and consistent navigation and structure
            throughout the website.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>3. Assistive Technologies</h2>
          <p>
            We aim to be compatible with a variety of assistive technologies,
            such as screen readers and voice recognition software. Users who
            rely on these tools should be able to access and interact with our
            website with ease.
