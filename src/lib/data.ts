    question: "What exactly does Fonts & Footers build?",
    answer:
      "We specialize in high-conversion direct-booking websites for service businesses—salons, wellness studios, clinics, trainers, chauffeurs, pet groomers, equipment/vehicle rentals, and more. Our sites focus on one thing: turning visitors into paid, deposit-secured appointments.",
    sections: ["home", "about"],
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "How long does it take to launch?",
    answer:
      "Typical ranges: Solo (single calendar) 10–21 days, Team (multi-staff) 3–6 weeks, Multi-Location/Rental 6–10 weeks. Timelines include discovery, design, build, integrations, and QA. Rush options are available when content and decisions are ready on day one.",
    sections: ["home", "work"],
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question:
      "How do your plans differ (Solo vs Team vs Multi-Location vs Rental/Fleet vs Custom)?",
    answer:
      "Solo: one bookable calendar and simple upsells. Team: multiple staff calendars, role-based access, Google/365 sync. Multi-Location: location routing, hours/policies per site. Rental/Fleet: inventory, blackout dates, holds/returns. Custom: bespoke features and integrations.",
    sections: ["work", "pricing", "home"],
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "How do deposits, cancellations, and no-shows work?",
    answer:
      "Your site enforces your policy. We can collect non-refundable deposits or full prepayment, set cancellation windows, require card-on-file, charge late/no-show fees, and auto-send SMS/email reminders with links to reschedule inside your policy rules.",
    sections: ["home", "pricing", "contact"],
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Which payment processor do you use?",
    answer:
      "Stripe is our default for cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and subscription/membership billing. We can also integrate PayPal or regional options on request. You keep the merchant account and receive payouts directly.",
    sections: ["home", "pricing"],
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "How is billing structured (setup fee and monthly)?",
    answer:
      "Most clients choose a one-time setup fee plus a monthly platform fee. You can either: (A) pay setup + first month at signup, renew on the 1st, or (B) pay setup + a prorated first month and then renew on the 1st. Annual prepay gets 20% off the monthly rate.",
    sections: ["pricing"],
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "What’s included in the monthly fee?",
    answer:
      "Hosting, security updates, core feature updates, uptime monitoring, minor content tweaks, and support. Optional add-ons include growth experiments (A/B tests), SEO/content retainers, advanced dashboards, and custom feature work.",
    sections: ["pricing", "home"],
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "Do SMS reminders cost extra?",
    answer:
      "Yes. SMS is billed at pass-through vendor rates (usage-based). We’ll estimate volumes during onboarding and set sensible limits so you control costs while keeping no-shows low.",
    sections: ["pricing"],
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question:
      "Can you migrate me from Calendly, GlossGenius, Vagaro, Mindbody, or Square?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We migrate services, staff, locations, and—where exportable—clients and future bookings. We also set up redirects and ‘we’ve moved’ messaging to make the transition painless for your customers.",
    sections: ["contact", "work"],
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "Will this replace my existing CRM or POS?",
    answer:
      "Often we complement them. We can push new leads/clients to your CRM, sync calendars (Google/365), and keep Stripe as your payments source of truth. If you need a full replacement, we’ll scope what’s realistic.",
    sections: ["contact", "about"],
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    question: "Do you support memberships, packages, and gift cards?",
    answer:
      "Yes—memberships with recurring billing, credit packs, punch cards, promo codes, and digital gift cards. Redemptions and balances are handled inside the booking flow.",
    sections: ["pricing", "home"],
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    question: "How do you handle multi-location and staff availability?",
    answer:
      "Rules per location (hours, buffers, services) and per staff (skills, breaks, travel time). Users pick location → provider → time, or we auto-assign by rules. Everything respects your blackout dates and real-time conflicts.",
    sections: ["work"],
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    question: "Can I upsell add-ons during booking?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We support one-click add-ons, bundles, and time-aware upsells that adjust service length and price. Cross-sells can appear on confirmation and reminder flows too.",
    sections: ["pricing", "work", "home"],
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    question: "What about rentals, fleets, or equipment scheduling?",
    answer:
      "We track inventory per asset, availability windows, prep/turnover time, holds/returns, deposits, and damages. Pricing can vary by day, duration, or season, with blackout logic for maintenance.",
    sections: ["work", "pricing"],
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    question: "What tech stack do you use?",
    answer:
      "Next.js for the front end, a Postgres database via Prisma, NextAuth for secure access, Stripe for payments, and best-in-class services for email/SMS and analytics. It’s fast, secure, and highly customizable.",
    sections: ["about", "work"],
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    question: "Where is my site hosted? Vercel or AWS?",
    answer:
      "By default we deploy on Vercel for speed and reliability. If you have specific requirements (VPC, regional data residency, enterprise SLAs), we can architect an AWS deployment as a custom engagement.",
    sections: ["about", "pricing"],
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    question: "Is the site fast and SEO-ready?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We build for Core Web Vitals with image optimization, code splitting, caching/CDN, and schema markup for services, reviews, and FAQs. We set up GA4 (or privacy-friendly analytics) and basic on-page SEO at launch.",
    sections: ["home", "blog"],
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    question: "Do you handle accessibility?",
    answer:
      "We design against WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines—color contrast, focus states, keyboard navigation, and semantic structure. Accessibility is an ongoing discipline; we include audits and fixes before launch.",
    sections: ["about", "work"],
  },
  {
    id: 19,
    question: "Is this HIPAA compliant for clinics/med-spas?",
    answer:
      "We’re not an EHR. We minimize PHI in the booking layer and integrate HIPAA-eligible vendors for intake forms and messaging when needed. For regulated workflows, we’ll scope compliant patterns with your counsel and vendors.",
    sections: ["about"],
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    question: "Who owns the content and data?",
    answer:
      "You own your brand, domain, copy, images, and customer/booking data. We license the platform code to you as part of your subscription. On request, we can export your data if you decide to move.",
    sections: ["about", "pricing"],
  },
  {
    id: 21,
    question: "What happens if I cancel?",
    answer:
      "We’ll schedule a clean wind-down, turn off renewals, and provide a data export (clients, bookings, products/services). If you need migration support or a static export, we can add that as a one-time service.",
    sections: ["contact", "pricing"],
  },
  {
    id: 22,
    question: "Can my team edit content without code?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You’ll get an admin with safe controls to manage services, pricing, staff schedules, blackout dates, policies, FAQs, promos, and blog posts. We also provide quick-reference docs and a training call.",
    sections: ["work", "contact"],
  },
  {
    id: 23,
    question: "Do you provide copywriting and photography?",
    answer:
      "We can. Many clients start with our conversion-ready defaults, then add on brand copy and photography to elevate the experience. We also offer guided prompts to move fast if you’re DIY-inclined.",
    sections: ["blog", "about"],
  },
  {
    id: 24,
    question: "Can you integrate reviews and UGC?",
    answer:
      "Yes—native testimonials, Google reviews pull-ins, and simple UGC uploads (with moderation) to showcase real results. We add schema so those reviews help search visibility.",
    sections: ["blog", "work"],
  },
  {
    id: 25,
    question: "Do you guarantee traffic or rankings?",
    answer:
      "We focus on conversion and retention—turning your existing attention into paid appointments. We’ll set a foundation for SEO and ads, but traffic volume depends on your market and marketing. We can run experiments to grow it.",
    sections: ["home", "blog"],
  },
  {
    id: 26,
    question: "Will you copy components from Webflow or Framer templates?",
    answer:
      "We reference patterns that work but build original, code-owned components tailored to your brand and flow. That keeps you fast, unique, and legally clean with full control over UX and performance.",
    sections: ["work", "about"],
  },
  {
    id: 27,
    question: "What analytics and dashboards do I get?",
    answer:
      "A bookings dashboard with revenue, utilization, no-show rate, channel attribution, and cohort retention. We wire GA4 (or Plausible/Matomo) and set up event tracking for funnel steps and conversions.",
    sections: ["work", "pricing"],
  },
  {
    id: 28,
    question: "Do you support multi-language or international customers?",
    answer:
      "Yes—language toggles, localized content, and time-zone-aware scheduling. If you serve multiple regions, we can vary services, pricing, and policies by locale.",
    sections: ["blog", "work"],
  },
  {
    id: 29,
    question: "How do refunds and disputes work?",
    answer:
      "Refunds follow your policy and are issued through Stripe. For disputes, we help assemble evidence (policy acceptance, reminder logs, visit history) to improve win rates.",
    sections: ["pricing", "contact"],
  },
  {
    id: 30,
    question: "What about emails and notifications?",
    answer:
      "We brand your transactional emails and SMS, including confirmations, reminders, reschedules, waitlist clears, membership renewals, and review requests. You control timing and tone.",
    sections: ["work", "contact"],
  },
  {
    id: 31,
    question: "Can you import my existing client list and future appointments?",
    answer:
      "Yes—CSV imports for clients and services are straightforward. Future bookings can usually be migrated if your current system supports export; we’ll map fields and validate before going live.",
    sections: ["work", "contact"],
  },
  {
    id: 32,
    question: "What security measures do you take?",
    answer:

    id: 33,
    question: "Do you offer support after launch?",
    answer:
      "Definitely. You’ll have a dedicated support channel for fixes and small changes, plus options for ongoing experiments and new features. Most questions are answered same or next business day.",
    sections: ["about", "contact", "home"],
  },
  {
    id: 34,
    question: "Can I run promotions, discounts, and limited-time offers?",
    answer:
      "Yes—promo codes, first-visit offers, membership-only pricing, and time-boxed discounts. We can show urgency variables (spots left, timers) without harming UX.",
    sections: ["pricing"],
  },
  {
    id: 35,
    question: "What content do you need from me to start?",
    answer:
      "Brand assets (logo, colors, fonts), services and pricing, policies, hours, staff bios, location details, and any photos. If anything is missing, we’ll provide guided templates and fill gaps with best-practice defaults.",
    sections: ["contact", "work"],
  },
  {
    id: 36,
    question: "Do you work on contracts or month-to-month?",

    id: 37,
    question: "Can you add a blog or resources section?",

    sections: ["blog"],

    id: 38,
    question: "Do you handle email marketing and CRM automations?",
    answer:
      "We’ll integrate your tool of choice (Klaviyo, Mailchimp, HubSpot, etc.) and tag key events (lead, booking, no-show, renewal). If you need flows built, we can add that as a growth engagement.",
    sections: ["blog", "work"],

  {
    id: 39,
    question: "Can I approve the design before development?",
    answer:

    id: 40,
    question: "What makes Fonts & Footers different?",
